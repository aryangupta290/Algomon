IDEA : 
The idea is inspired by the classic game of pokemon, with an algorithmic
twist. Instead of collecting pokemons, we shall collect algorithms! It will be a
role-playing game based around collecting algorithms. The game will be held
in a discord server with users registering using their discord handles. From
time to time, various algorithms will spawn in the chat. Users will be notified
when an algorithm/technique is ready to be collected. Few algorithms might
have some prerequisites, and in this case only users who have collected the
list of algorithms/techniques described as prerequisites will stand a chance to
collect the algorithm.

How to collect an algorithm?

Once a user is eligible to collect an algorithm, and messages the command to
collect the algorithm, he/she will be sent a list of tasks to complete.

Algorithms covered : 

The Algorithms which we are thinking to include are as follows:
1) Greedy Algorithms like MST , etc
2) Sorting and searching Algorithms
3) Recursion and Backtracking
4) Divide and Conquer Algorithms like FFT
5) Dynamic Programming
6) Graph Algorithms like Tarjan’s Algorithm , Dijkstra etc .

The submission consists of:
- Code for the 2 discord bots: 1 for management and other for quiz.
- Webpages of all the articles and content we wrote.
- Source code for the main page of algoMon
1. The first bot is hosted on replit.com. The source code has an empty variable
“BOT_TOKEN” which can be changed to run the code through any bot.
2. The second bot is to be hosted locally by running the run.sh script.
3. The website is hosted here -> https://keyurchd11.github.io/
4. The individual webpages for all the content written is available as web pages in the
“StudyMaterial” directory.
5. The questions used for the quiz bot are available in the “Questions” subdirectory in
TriviaBot.
