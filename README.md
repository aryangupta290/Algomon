# DESCRIPTION
The idea is inspired by the classic game of pokemon, with an algorithmic
twist. Instead of collecting pokemons, we shall collect algorithms! It will be a
role-playing game based around collecting algorithms. The game will be held
in a discord server with users registering using their discord handles. From
time to time, various algorithms will spawn in the chat. Users will be notified
when an algorithm/technique is ready to be collected. Few algorithms might
have some prerequisites, and in this case only users who have collected the
list of algorithms/techniques described as prerequisites will stand a chance to
collect the algorithm.

How to collect an algorithm?

Once a user is eligible to collect an algorithm, and messages the command to
collect the algorithm, he/she will be sent a list of tasks to complete.

# Algorithms covered 

The Algorithms included are as follows:
* Greedy Algorithms like MST , etc
* Sorting and searching Algorithms
* Recursion and Backtracking
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms like FFT
* Dynamic Programming
* Graph Algorithms like Tarjan’s Algorithm , Dijkstra etc 

The submission consists of:

* The Management bot is hosted on replit.com. The source code has an empty variable
“BOT_TOKEN” which can be changed to run the code through any bot.  
* The Qiuz bot is to be hosted locally by running the ```run.sh``` script.  
* The website is hosted at ```https://keyurchd11.github.io/```  
* The individual webpages for all the content written is available as web pages in the
“StudyMaterial” directory.  
* The questions used for the quiz bot are available in the “Questions” subdirectory in
TriviaBot.
